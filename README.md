# Resume Forge

Howdy y'all, and welcome to the resume forge.

To get started, just run `docker-compose up`, or `npm install` & `npm run dev`.

Alternatively, check out [my resume](https://arthur.operatorai.com). There's a template in `sub.py` for setting it up as a globally distributed service.

If you're a cool cucumber, and want to help me out, at some point, I want to attach [aider](https://github.com/paul-gauthier/aider) with `App.jsx` as context (the frontend).

I've had a phenomenal time telling my resume to change something in the terminal and watching it update in real time in the browser.

## Other cool potential features go here!

more components - always welcome

another style   - I want to look shinier

ats cracker     - I don't have this automated yet
